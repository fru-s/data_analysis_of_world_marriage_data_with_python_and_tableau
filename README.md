# data_analysis_of_world_marriage_data_with_python_and_tableau
As the topic of my first open analysis project I chose the World Marriage Data 2019 from the Official Website of the UN. Within the dataset I decided to focus on uncovering trends in two indicators: SMAM and Ever Married and through Geographical and Regression Analysis in Python and Tableau I discovered some valuable insights

### Key Questions
- Is there a relationship between the SMAM and ever married data? Or SMAM and the proportion of divorces?
- What have been the marital trends been in the past 50 years globally and in different regions/countries?
- How do the different valuables relate to each other?
- What are typical differences between the sexes?

### Data Set
Data set was downloaded from an Official Website of the UN https://population.un.org/MarriageData/Index.html#/home.
